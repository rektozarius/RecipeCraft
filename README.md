# RecipeCraft App

RecipeCraft is a multi-page web app designed for health-conscious food enthusiasts to discover ingredients, design custom recipes, and track their nutritional values. Users can search for ingredients by leveraging the [Nutritionix API](https://docx.syndigo.com/developers/docs/nutritionix-api-guide), save favorite ingredients, and assemble step-by-step recipes with ingredient quantities and cooking instructions.

## Design

RecipeCraft mimics the color/brand palette of [Nutritionix](https://brandfetch.com/nutritionix.com).
